[size=5][b][color=#e6bd72]Overview[/color][/b][/size]

Many pieces of equipment that apply status effects have an internal cooldown of "once per attack", likely to prevent damage rider sources from inflicting debuffs more times than intended. However, this has a pretty serious problem: it makes these items completely incompatible with area-of-effect (AOE) attacks. For example, if you're wearing the [url=https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Gloves_of_Belligerent_Skies]Gloves of Belligerent Skies[/url], and you drop a fat [url=https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Thunderwave]Thunderwave[/url] on a cluster of three enemies, only [i]one[/i] of them will receive any Reverberation stacks.

This mod reworks the internal cooldowns for these items to instead be "once per attack per enemy". This significantly improves the viability of this gear for AOE builds, letting your Tiger Heart Barbarian spread Reverberation onto three enemies in a single cleave, and your Wizard disperse Poison onto an entire battlefield with one array of Magic Missiles.

[*]Note that this differs from the fix implemented in the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5595]Unofficial Bug Fixer[/url] mod, which allows these gloves to spread Reverberation, but only once, and only if the target does not already have the status, which makes them somewhat incompatible with the other Reverberation items. As a result, I'd strongly recommend loading the Unofficial Bug Fixer [b]before[/b] this mod, so that it can be overwritten.

[*]Refactored internal logic to only roll a saving throw if it will be used. Before, any attack from the wielder of the Hellrider Longbow would add a saving throw to the combat log, even if the result wouldn't be used because the attack was initiated with a different weapon.

[url=https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Markoheshkir]Markoheshkir[/url]'s special ability, [url=https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Kereska%27s_Favour]Kereska's Favour[/url], has six elemental variants. Four of them apply statuses â€” but only once per attack, which makes this legendary staff feel a little bit less legendary. This mod improves all four of these variants:
